I have downloaded the wordsapi_sample.json as a free sample data from the WordsAPI website: 

https://www.wordsapi.com/

The very download link: 

https://s3.amazonaws.com/wordsapi/wordsapi_sample.zip

Then I reduced the data inside wordsapi_sample.json to contain only pure words with {definition & partOfSpeech} without digits etc. just for the hangman purpose.

I only use the reduced data inside a hangman website game, which has been created for the Portfolio purpose.
